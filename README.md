# JayCaster

JayCaster is a JavaScript implementation of the 'raycasting' algorithm that powered early first-person shooters like 1992's Wolfenstein 3D.

## Demo

You can view a live demo here: [https://shinyhut.github.io/jaycaster/](http://shinyhut.github.io/jaycaster/)

## Running

To run in an embedded web server for local development:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

To build for production:

```
npm install
npm run build
```
and deploy from `./dist/`

## Compatibility

JayCaster works well in Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Edge (Chromium). IE11 and Edge (classic) are also supported, but  performance is poor compared to modern browsers.
